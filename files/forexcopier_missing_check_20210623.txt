Hello,
I purchased the Forex Copier 2 and Forex Copier 3. I'm now running Forex copier 2 for multiple live accounts and also testing Copier 3.

I had an some accident for running FX accounts.
I run 1 Sender in master account and 12 Receivers on 12 accounts. The problem was 1 account missed Receiver EA 15 days ago, I didn't find it. Today while I add more account as a receiver through 'Apply', the old orders (that did not closed because Receiver is missing) are closed simultaneously after Forex Copier Manager 'apply'. Then old ordes caused much money loss. 
Then I may ask your favor...
"Is there any way to check  if the specified EA (Sender or Receiver) is running in Another chart ?"

Please kindly help me, Best Regards,
Dongsoo Lee
